        //JS always passes by value for primitive data types
        //but passes by refrence for non-primitive data type: array, object functino.

        //Passing by value means that every time you assign a value to a variable, a copy of that value is created.
        let a = 1;
        let b = a; 
        console.log(a, b); // 1 1
        b = b + 2;
        console.log(a, b); // 1 3 Since a copy of value of a was passed, the value of a on changing b was not affected
        a = 5;
        console.log(a,b); // 5 3 Since a copy of a was passed to b, on changing 'a' 'b' was not affected.
        
        //Passing by reference
        //When creating an object youâ€™re given a reference to that object, it does not directly hold the object. 
        //If 2 variables hold the same reference, then changing the object reflects in both variables.

        //The following statement would create an array, defines a varible x, and initializes the variable with refrence of that array
        let x = [1,2,3];
        //defines a variable y, and initializes y with the reference stored in x variable
        let y = x;
        console.log(x,y)
        //now if I change y
        y.push(4);
        console.log(x, y); //The change done is reflected in both the arrays.
        //and say if i do:
        y = [];
        console.log(x, y);
        //This does not change x.
        //When you assign a new value to one of the variables, you're just modifying the value that variable holds. 
        //The variable now ceases to hold a reference to the object, and instead holds something else. 
        //The other variable still holds its reference to the original object, the assignment didn't influence it at all.
